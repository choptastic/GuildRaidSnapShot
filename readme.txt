The code for the "GetGRSSDKP.exe" program is found in "GetGRSSDKP.pl" a perl
program using Perl/Tk.  You'll need to get a version of perl (www.perl.org) to 
run that script in raw form.

If you wish to compile it yourself, get nmake from the following address

http://web.archive.org/web/20080822004405/http://www.expertsrt.com/tutorials/Matt/perlPAR.html

Then compile it with the following line:

pp --gui -o GetGRSSDKP.exe getGRSSDKP.pl

This is also the line found in compile.bat, which is more convenient than typing that command every time.
